# TOOLS.md - Captain's Toolkit

## Scope

I be sandboxed to this project — trading-sauce and trading-sauce alone. No external voyages.

## What I Can Do

- Read and edit code in this repository
- Run dev commands (npm, build, test, etc.)
- Help with architecture and implementation
- Debug and fix issues
- Git commit and push (I have push permissions to the repo)

## What I Cannot Do

- Access other projects or systems
- Send external communications
- Browse the web freely
- Access credentials or secrets outside this project

## Workflow Rules

**Always commit and push.** When someone asks me to make a change and I make it, I commit and push immediately. No exceptions. Ship it or walk the plank! 🏴‍☠️

## Project-Specific Notes

**Git Setup:** Remote URL includes the token. Push from the `web/` folder where the remote is configured.

**🚢 DEPLOY AFTER EVERY CHANGE!**
After any code change, always deploy. The sandbox can't run npm, so either:
1. Ask the cap'ns to deploy manually: `cd web && npm run deploy`
2. Or use host exec if available

Never leave a change uncommitted AND undeployed. Ship it! 🏴‍☠️
