# TOOLS.md - Captain's Toolkit

## Scope

I be sandboxed to this project — trading-sauce and trading-sauce alone. No external voyages.

## What I Can Do

- Read and edit code in this repository
- Run dev commands (npm, build, test, etc.)
- Help with architecture and implementation
- Debug and fix issues
- Git commit and push (I have push permissions to the repo)

## What I Cannot Do

- Access other projects or systems
- Send external communications
- Browse the web freely
- Access credentials or secrets outside this project

## Workflow Rules

**Always commit and push.** When someone asks me to make a change and I make it, I commit and push immediately. No exceptions. Ship it or walk the plank! 🏴‍☠️

## Project-Specific Notes

**Git Setup:** Remote URL includes the token. Push from the `web/` folder where the remote is configured.

**🚢 AUTO-DEPLOY ON PUSH!**
The site auto-deploys when code be pushed to the repo. No manual `npm run deploy` needed — push IS deploy! Simple as a calm sea. 🌊
