# 2026-02-17 — Tick Sweep Complete, Entry Model Confirmed

## Trail & Auto-BE Sweep (TICK DATA — REAL RESULTS)

Tick data is loaded (212M MNQ ticks, 251 sessions, 1 year). The sweep that was blocked on Feb 16 is now complete.

**79 configs tested. V1 baseline wins. No trail or BE improves it.**

### Baseline (V1 — no trail, no BE)
PF 1.33 | PnL 1,067 | WR 15.0% | MaxDD 507

### Key Findings
- **Trailing stops universally hurt.** Every single trail config produced less PnL than baseline. Best trail-only (Trail@50/5) lost 25% of total PnL.
- **Aggressive BE (5-10pt) boosts PF but halves PnL.** BE@5 has PF 1.63 but only 709 PnL.
- **BE@55 is the only interesting alternative:** PF 1.34, PnL 1,046, MaxDD 404 (vs baseline 507). Marginally better PF with lower drawdown, at cost of ~20pt PnL.
- **BE@70 marginally beats baseline PnL (1,087 vs 1,067)** — within noise.
- **Combined trail+BE strictly worse than either alone.**

### Top 5 by PF
1. BE@5 — PF 1.63, PnL 709, DD 270
2. BE@10+Trail@50/5 — PF 1.36, PnL 666, DD 443
3. BE@10 — PF 1.35, PnL 639, DD 536
4. BE@55 — PF 1.34, PnL 1,046, DD 404
5. BE@70 — PF 1.34, PnL 1,087, DD 507

**Conclusion for Sweep 1: V1 bracket (10.25/82.25, no trail, no BE) is confirmed optimal for 1 trade/day.**

## Sweep 2: Blind Re-Entry (TICK DATA — REAL RESULTS)

**Rule**: If first trade SLs on its entry candle, blind re-enter on next candle same direction. Max 2 trades/day. If stop-out is NOT on entry candle, still max 1 trade/day.

**80 configs tested. RE+BE@5 is the overall winner across BOTH sweeps.**

### Baselines
- Sweep 1 (no reentry): PF 1.33 | PnL 1,067 | 369 trades | DD 507
- Sweep 2 (+ reentry, no BE): PF 1.18 | PnL 1,076 | 577 trades (208 re) | DD 1,166

### Key Findings
- **Raw reentry without BE is WORSE** — PF drops 1.33→1.18, DD more than doubles
- **RE+BE@5 is the standout winner**: PF 1.54, PnL 1,488 (+40% vs Sweep 1), DD 725
- **RE+BE@10+Trail combos strong**: PF 1.38-1.39, PnL 1,290-1,425
- Best risk-adjusted: RE+BE@10+Trail@40/15 — PF 1.38, PnL 1,290, DD 577

### Top 5 by PF
1. RE+BE@5 — PF 1.54, PnL 1,488, DD 725
2. RE+BE@10+Trail@50/10 — PF 1.39, PnL 1,425, DD 677
3. RE+BE@10+Trail@40/10 — PF 1.39, PnL 1,307, DD 610
4. RE+BE@10+Trail@50/15 — PF 1.38, PnL 1,393, DD 690
5. RE+BE@10+Trail@40/15 — PF 1.38, PnL 1,290, DD 577

**Fabian's intuition confirmed**: BE@5 + reentry is the strongest combo. ~40% of trades are re-entries, net positive because BE@5 cuts losers fast.

## V1 Entry Model — NO Doji Scanning

Fabian asked if the backtest checks for dojis before entry. **It does NOT.**

### V1 Entry Path (strictDualConfirmation: true)
1. Both ES + MNQ break past ±2σ → BREAKOUT
2. Wait for **dual reversal candles** (both products close in pullback direction) → pullback confirmed
3. Wait for **dual continuation candles** (both products close in trend direction) → ENTRY fires

That's it. The `isDualBodyDirection()` function checks `close > open` (or vice versa). No body ratio, no doji definition, no reversal candle scan.

### Where Doji Logic DOES Exist (but V1 never reaches it)
- `WAITING_DOJI` phase is only entered from the **semi-clean HVN path** (when `hvnOverlayEnabled` is true)
- V1 uses `BASE_SHOTGUN_MODE`, not HVN sniper mode
- So `WAITING_DOJI` is **never reached** in V1 backtests
- `dojiMaxBodyRatio` and `dojiTimeoutCandles` config values exist but are **inert in V1**

### CRITICAL: Do NOT claim doji logic is active in V1. It is not.

## Webhook Open Price Bug (Fixed)

- Pine Script was never sending open prices
- Worker was faking opens as prev.close → wrong candle bodies → wrong doji detection → wrong signals
- Fixed: Pine rewritten with real OHLC JSON format
- Backfilled Databento candles Feb 12-17 with real opens
- This does NOT affect the backtest (backtest uses Databento candles which always had real opens)

---

## Fabian's Notes
- Using SL 10 / TP 80 on Monday (close to V1's 10.25/82.25)
- Open Drive / Liquidity Drive logic needs defining but "no rush"
- Wants a name for the continuation setup (not "A+" or "continuation")
- Weekend session bleeding into Monday — bands already wide
- Fund talk: keeping system private/black box
