## Fabian's Day

### Results
- **Passed 2 x 50k Apex evals** 🔥
- **+$750 cash account**
- 2 clean NQ setups

### Mood
Confident, disciplined. Clean execution day.

### Account Status
- 2 funded Apex accounts ($2,500 trailing each)
- Cash: $2,300
- Total buying power: ~$7.5k across prop + cash

### Rules
- Sticking with 5% risk on all 3 accounts
- New rule: $2,000 cash floor (with 2+ funded accounts)
- Plan to buy more $20 evals during sale (ends Wed)

### Notes
- $20 eval + $75 activation = $95 per funded account (cheap)
- Can delay activation but fee goes up to ~$135
- Strategy: buy evals now, only activate when cash allows
