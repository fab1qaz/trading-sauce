## Session Summary
Volatile chop day. Fabian trading BTC based on 5-month chart setup.

## Key Activity
- Multiple entries/exits on BTC longs - very choppy
- Using ES 5-month POC as confluence for BTC entries
- Dojis on ES and MNQ during session

## Position
- Long 1 MBT on 11 Apex accounts + 1 cash account
- Total exposure: ~1.2 BTC (without owning any spot)
- Entry around 69k, target 88k

## Market Read
- Intraday bullish structure
- Monthly: recovered -2σ 
- ES weekly POC TP-ers may have caused the chop
- BTC showing strength vs indices (decoupling slightly)

## Lessons/Mistakes
- ❌ Longed yesterday while AFK → intraday dropped → burned $400
- Rule: Don't hold intraday positions when not watching

## Mood
Optimistic but cautious. Recognizes it's tricky/volatile. Willing to let it ride now.

## Quotes
- "defo too juicy to ignore"
