## Monte Carlo Trading Simulations

### Fabian's Setup
- Starting balance: $1,500
- Weekly bills: $222 (non-negotiable)
- Trading edge: 40% win rate, 3:1 R:R = +0.6R expected per trade
- 10 trades per week (expected +6R weekly)
- Bills deducted end of each week (after Friday trades)

### Key Findings from 100k Simulations ($222/week bills)
| Risk % | Survival | Median Balance (12 weeks) |
|--------|----------|---------------------------|
| 7.0%   | 92.33%   | $41k                      |
| 9.0%   | 91.64%   | $95k                      |
| 10.0%  | 91.15%   | $129k                     |
| 11.0%  | 90.30%   | $177k                     |

### 10-Run Detailed Simulation (7% risk)
- All 10 runs survived (no blowups)
- Range: +118% to +34,198% over 12 weeks
- The +0.6R edge is robust enough to handle $222/week bills

### Strategy Recommendations
- **7%**: Safest, ~92% survival
- **9-10%**: Sweet spot - balanced risk/reward
- **11%+**: Aggressive, ~90% survival but higher median

### Apex Prop Account Plan
- Use Apex 50k eval ($20) as backup to cover bills
- Let cash account compound untouched if possible
- Prop account acts as "income" while cash grows

## Decision Pending
Fabian deciding between 7% (safe), 9-10% (balanced), or 11%+ (aggressive) risk per trade.
